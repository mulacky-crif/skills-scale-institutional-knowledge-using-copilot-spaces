# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This collection of process documents provides a comprehensive guide to how OctoAcme runs projects, from initiation through release and retrospective.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on customer-first principles, iterative delivery, and clear ownership. Our processes emphasize delivering small, testable increments with data-informed decisions and psychological safety for team members. Each project is managed by a named Project Manager (PM) who coordinates delivery, schedules, and communications, working closely with a Product Manager (PdM) who defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog.

The project lifecycle follows five key phases: Initiation (problem definition and stakeholder alignment), Planning (creating actionable backlogs and timelines), Execution (building and tracking progress with daily standups and weekly syncs), Release (deploying with proper verification and rollback plans), and Retrospective (capturing learnings for continuous improvement). Throughout each phase, we maintain key artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, risk registers, and retrospective notes to ensure transparency and alignment.

Communication is central to our approach, with structured touchpoints including weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. We manage risks proactively through a risk register that tracks impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies, with clear escalation paths when needed. Quality assurance is embedded throughout our workflows, with automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, code review requirements, and acceptance criteria validation before release.

Our documentation is designed to help new team members quickly understand their role in the process and provide experienced practitioners with clear references for templates, checklists, and communication patterns. Whether you're a Developer, Product Manager, Project Manager, or Stakeholder, these guides will help you navigate the full project lifecycle with clarity and confidence.

2. **Read [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** to understand your role and responsibilities
3. **Review phase-specific documents** based on where your project is in the lifecycle
4. **Reference templates and checklists** as you work through your first project

### For Project Managers

Begin with [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) when starting a new project, then follow the lifecycle sequence through Planning, Execution, and Release. Keep the [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) guide handy for ongoing stakeholder updates.

### For Developers

Focus on [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) for daily workflows, PR conventions, and quality standards. Review [Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md) for understanding backlog items and acceptance criteria.

### For Product Managers

Start with [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) and [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) to align on success metrics and priorities. Use [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) for stakeholder engagement strategies.
