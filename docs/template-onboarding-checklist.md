## Common Onboarding Challenges

### Challenge: Overwhelming amount of information

### Challenge: Imposter syndrome or fear of asking questions
**Solution**: Normalize asking questions, create psychological safety, mentor shares their own learning journey

### Challenge: Unclear expectations or role ambiguity
**Solution**: Set clear goals for each week, provide role-specific milestones

### Challenge: Lack of access or technical blockers
**Solution**: Front-load access provisioning, have IT contact ready for troubleshooting

**Solution**: Schedule social activities, encourage informal chats, facilitate introductions
